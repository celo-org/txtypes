The stages of support are:

-   **Active support** 🟢: the transaction type is supported and recommended for use.
-   **Security support** 🟠: the transaction type is supported but not recommended for use
    because it might be deprecated in the future.
-   **Sunset** 🔴: the transaction type was supported in the past but will fail now.

## Background

### Legacy transactions

Ethereum originally had one format for transactions (now called "legacy transactions"). 
A legacy transaction contains the following transaction parameters:
`nonce`, `gasPrice`, `gasLimit`, `recipient`, `amount`, `data`, and `chaindId`.

To produce a valid "legacy transaction":

1.  the **transaction parameters** are [RLP-encoded](https://eth.wiki/fundamentals/rlp): 

    ```
    RLP([nonce, gasprice, gaslimit, recipient, amount, data, chaindId, 0, 0])
    ```

1.  the RLP-encoded transaction is hashed (using Keccak256).

1.  the hash is signed with a private key using the ECDSA algorithm, which generates the `v`, `r`, 
    and `s` **signature parameters**.

1.  the transaction _and_ signature parameters above are RLP-encoded to produce a valid **signed 
    transaction**:

    ```
    RLP([nonce, gasprice, gaslimit, recipient, amount, data, v, r, s])
    ```

A valid signed transaction can then be submitted on-chain, and its raw parameters can be 
parsed by RLP-decoding the transaction.

### Typed transactions

Over time, the Ethereum community has sought to add new types of transactions 
such as dynamic fee transactions 
([EIP-1559: Fee market change for ETH 1.0 chain](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559)) 
or optional access list transactions 
([EIP-2930: Optional access lists](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930)) 
to supported new desired behaviors on the network.

To allow new transactions to be supported without breaking support with the 
legacy transaction format, the concept of **typed transactions** was proposed in 
[EIP-2718: Typed Transaction Envelope](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718), which introduces 
a new high-level transaction format that is used to implement all future transaction types.

### Distinguishing between legacy and typed transactions

Whereas a valid "legacy transaction" is simply an RLP-encoded list of 
**transaction parameters**, a valid "typed transactions" is an arbitrary byte array 
prepended with a **transaction type**, where:

-   a **transaction type**, is a number between 0 (`0x00`) and 127 (`0x7f`) representing 
    the type of the transaction, and

-   a **transaction payload**, is arbitrary byte data that encodes raw transaction parameters 
    in compliance with the specified transaction type.

To distinguish between legacy transactions and typed transactions at the client level, 
the EIP designers observed that the **first byte** of a legacy transaction would never be in the range 
`[0, 0x7f]` (or `[0, 127]`), and instead always be in the range `[0xc0, 0xfe]` (or `[192, 254]`). 

With that observation, transactions can be decoded with the following heuristic:

-   read the first byte of a transaction
-   if it's bigger than `0x7f` (`127`), then it's a **legacy transaction**. To decode it, you 
    must read _all_ bytes (including the first byte just read) and interpret them as a 
    legacy transaction.
-   else, if it's smaller or equal to `0x7f` (`127`), then it's a **typed transaction**. To decode
    it you must read the _remaining_ bytes (excluding the first byte just read) and interpret them
    according to the specified transaction type.

Every transaction type is defined in an EIP, which specifies how to _encode_ as well as _decode_ 
transaction payloads. This means that a typed transaction can only be interpreted with knowledge of 
its transaction type and a relevant decoder.

## List of transaction types on Celo

### <img width="12" src="assets/images/Ethereum.png"> Legacy transaction (`0`)

> **NOTE**
> This transaction type is 100% compatible with Ethereum and has no Celo-specific parameters.

they are commonly referred to as "type 0" transactions.
